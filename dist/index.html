<!-- 			<h2>About Vincent van Gogh</h2> -->
			<p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. His works include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterized by bold colors and expressive brushwork.</p>
        <p>Vincent van Gogh was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is widely considered to be one of the greatest artists of all time. He was born in the Netherlands in 1853, and despite having a difficult and often troubled life, he produced some of the most iconic and enduring works of art in history.</p>
      <p>Van Gogh began his career as an artist relatively late in life, at the age of 27. He initially worked as an art dealer, but after he was fired from his job, he began to devote himself to painting full-time. His early works were heavily influenced by the Dutch masters, but he soon developed his own unique style.</p>
      <p>One of van Gogh's most famous works is "The Starry Night", which he painted in 1889 while he was staying at an asylum in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, France. The painting depicts a night sky filled with swirling stars and a bright crescent moon, as well as a small town nestled in a valley. The painting is considered a masterpiece of post-impressionist art, and has become one of the most recognized and beloved works of art in the world.</p>
      <p>Another of van Gogh's most famous works is "Sunflowers", a series of paintings that he created between 1888 and 1889. The paintings depict a vase of sunflowers against a yellow background, and are notable for their bright, vibrant colors and thick, expressive brushstrokes. The series is considered one of van Gogh's greatest achievements, and has become an enduring symbol of the beauty of nature and the power of art.</p>
      <p>Despite his immense talent and creativity, van Gogh struggled with mental illness for much of his life. He suffered from frequent episodes of depression, and ultimately died by suicide in 1890, at the age of 37. However, his impact on the art world has been immeasurable, and his work continues to inspire and move people to this day.</p>
